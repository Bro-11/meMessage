# meMessage

meMessage is the newest project that I am only *helping* make. Most (99.98%) of the code is my friend's, I simply help debug and fix small things. Also, I maintain the repository and version history, in case it could be of use to anyone wanting to attempt a similar feat or learn about how someone might pull this off.
